        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Thrift-hub is an online store that sells second-hand items at a discounted price. 
            Individuals frequently donate these things or buy them in large quantities from charities or other organisations. 
            While decreasing waste and encouraging environmental responsibility, our mission is to offer economical and environmentally friendly buying options.

        </p>
        <p>The main difference between a thrift-hub and any retail store out there is that the items for sale here arent brand new, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t in good condition. 
            Thrift-hub is a way of giving those items new life. 
            Our main objective is to offer customers well priced, durable and good quality pieces - all while reducing wastage and being environmentally friendly.
